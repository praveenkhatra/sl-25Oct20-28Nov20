- Puppet installation and Configuration
- Puppet apply (local config)
- Puppet agent (centralized management)
- Puppet Modules creation
- Puppet Module from forge.puppet.com

## Installation
_See Document "Puppetinstallation.md_

## Important config files

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf --> Main configuration file
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl --> SSL Certificate and other relevant files
/etc/puppetlabs/code --> Main folder where all things Puppet are stored on Puppet Server
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production

## Puppet Apply

vi localconfig.pp

package { 'tree':
    ensure => 'installed',
}
file { '/tmp/info.txt':
    ensure => 'present',
    content => "This file was created via puppet"
}
user { 'sk12k':
    ensure => 'present',
    password => '123456',
    shell      => '/bin/bash',
    home       => '/home/sk12k',
}

Run 
puppet apply localconfig.pp

References:
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.17/man/apply.html


cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
vi site.pp
Put the following content inside sit.pp

node default {
    package { 'tree':
        ensure  => 'installed',
    }
    file { '/tmp/info.txt':
        ensure  => 'present',
        content => "This file was created via puppet"
    }
    user { 'sk12k':
        ensure  => 'present',
        password=> '123456',
        shell   => '/bin/bash',
        home    => '/home/sk12k',
    }
}

Save the file.

Note: notice first line of the code (“node default”)

(Optional) Validate the syntax using the following:

puppet parser validate site.pp

If there is no error, it means there is no syntactical error in the file.

Run the following on all nodes:

puppet agent -t

## Working with Modules

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
In order to create and work with new modules we need to install Puppet Development Kit.
apt-get install pdk

Generate a new module using “pdk new module <modulename>”

pdk new module slprodenv
Puppet is going to ask a series of questions:
We'll be prompted with a series of questions:
[Q 1/4] If you have a Puppet Forge username, add it here.
We can use this to upload your module to the Forge when it's complete.
--> sk12k

[Q 2/4] Who wrote this module?
This is used to credit the module's author.
--> sk12k

[Q 3/4] What license does this module code fall under?
This should be an identifier from https://spdx.org/licenses/. Common values are "Apache-2.0", "MIT", or "proprietary".
--> Apache-2.0

[Q 4/4] What operating systems does this module support?
Use the up and down keys to move between the choices, space to select and enter to continue.
--> RedHat based Linux, Debian based Linux, Windows (Use arrow or number (1-7) keys, pres--> RedHat based Linux, Debian based Linux

Metadata will be generated based on this information, continue? Yes

Following is an output of “tree” command for /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production

## Using a Module from Puppet Forge
1. Search for a specific Module
puppet module search <keyword>
puppet module search ntp

2. Install required module
puppet module install <modulename>
puppet module install puppetlabs-ntp

3. Use the ntp module to install and configure ntp on all nodes
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
From the command line on the master, navigate to the directory that contains the main manifest: 
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
Use your text editor to open site.pp. 
Add the following Puppet code to site.pp: 
node default { 
  class { 'ntp':
        servers => servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
  }
}

Note: If your site.pp file already has a default node in it, add just the class and servers lines to it. 

On your agent, start a Puppet run:

puppet agent -t

4. Test NTP on all nodes
To check if the NTP service is running, run: 
puppet resource service ntpd

On Ubuntu operating systems, the service is ntp instead of ntpd. 
The result looks like this: 

service { 'ntpd':
  		  ensure => 'running',
 		  enable => 'true',
	}
